== Description ==

**Have you ever needed to quickly find the link to a specific imgage size?**

This plugin supports WordPress' **default image sizes** (thumbnail, medium, large) as well as any **custom image size** you may add to your site, using the native [add_image_size](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/) function or a third-party plugin such as [Simple Image Sizes](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/simple-image-sizes/).

__This is an **admin plugin**, it does not add anything to your theme or to public pages.__

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Go you the Media Library and click any image: the links will appear at the bottom of the page.
